👀 I’m looking to share and improve my skills forward a web development career

🌱 Inspired by the full-stack course on Codecademy wich i did, I’m currently improving my skills in Javascript, NodeJs, ReactJs, Express, Redux, MongoDB, Heroku, Html, CSS and obviously... Github, using the internet to get the maximum documentation as possible!
